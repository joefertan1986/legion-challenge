# Legion Front End Challenge

This challenge is intended to test your attention to detail, basic skills with HTML/CSS/JS, and problem-solving abilities.

## Objectives

1. **Change the general color theme** to use Legion's website colors [Legion Website](https://legionathletics.com).

2. **Make changes to the page copy** based on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mEdOf3LRzqmGoU6ACn5VsOLlKfsEspBFMq1TDNX4_0/edit?usp=sharing).

3. **Create a simple email opt-in** in the sidebar, then use jQuery `$.ajax` or `fetch` to submit the form.
   - Feel free to stub the URL to an imaginary endpoint.
   - Upon error and success, show an alert that says "Form submitted!".

4. **Add a dynamic “Featured Products” grid**
   - Use a small JSON file or inline JS object to store product data (title, price, image URL, short description).
   - Dynamically render these products on the `shop.html` page.
   - Include a “Load More” button that simulates loading additional items (even if it’s just splitting your data set in half).

5. **Implement a simple Cart or “Favorites” feature**
   - Let users click an “Add to Favorites” (or “Add to Cart”) button on a product.
   - Store that product’s ID (or name) in `localStorage`.
   - Update the UI (e.g., a small badge in the header) to show the current number of favorites.
   - Persist this data so it’s still there when the page is refreshed.
